        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p style=font-size:18pt;>As a digital storyteller, my skills encompass both the digital realm and the physical world.  I use thorough research and creative thinking to overcome challenges and deliver high-quality imagery to display the themes and messages desired.  Below are samples of my work in both a personal and professional space.</p>

            <h3>Walsworth Career Fair Redesign</h3>
    <div class=below>
            <p style=color:#E6B31E;>In the summer of 2019, I was working as a sales recruiting intern in the
corporate office of Walsworth Publishing. While working there, I was
asked to create new signage for use at college career fairs. I created
multiple banners of different sizes for their recruiting department.
This project allowed me to dig deep into a business’ image and create
designs that displayed these qualities. The work is easily customizable
and transportable, as well as shows the important aspects of the position
Walsworth was recruiting for. I learned much about the creative process
within a company setting and pitching concepts to executives.
Unfortunately, my work computer was not strong enough to efficiently run
Adobe Photoshop, so this was created on Canva.</p>

        <h3>Family Farm</h3>
                <p style=color:#E6B31E;>his is a short documentary I shot by myself in rural Missouri. The
            documentary follows a day in the life of a father-son farming operation as
            they rush to complete a day’s work before the coming winter. This documentary showed me the ropes in creating a long project from
            scratch with only myself. I am satisfied with the composition of the shots,
            but the audio could contain more life and a better mix of dialogue and
            diegetic sounds. If I could go back and reshoot, I would take more care in
            the capturing of sound and the discussions the farmers had.

        <h3>Cooking PSA</h3>
        <p>I was tasked with creating a relevant and interesting PSA that would
appeal to a chosen audience. I chose to direct this PSA to young, working
professionals who often choose takeout rather than a home-cooked meal.
By showing a high quality yet simple meal, I strive to communicate an
uplifting and encouraging message.Through careful research of the target audience, I discovered that younger
professionals feel as though they do not have the time to cook a meal
from home. Through careful recipe selection with simple and familiar
ingredients, I effectively shot and edited this PSA by myself. The pacing is
a bit frantic in my opinion and would have liked to slowed down the action
and really sit in the imagery more.</p>
