     Hello! My name is Thomas Krueger, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri. I will graduate in May of 2020 with a degree in Digital Storytelling and a Minor in Business.  I am searching for a job in the digital marketing field, and I am looking forward to speaking with clients and creating strategies with them to increase sales, recognition of their brand, and the value their brand holds.  I recently used Wix to create my first website so I could have a portfolio to send to businesses as I apply for a job, but it could certainly be improved in many aspects.  In this course, I hope to learn the basics of coding and creating a usable website so I can be even more versatile in the digital realm, and I hope to build on these lessons to become more familiar with the inner workings of the internet as a whole.  In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and spending time at my familyâ€™s lake house at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.
